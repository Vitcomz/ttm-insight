But Lampard got the better of his mentor Mourinho in a 2-0 win in their last encounter and the Sheffield United boss will be looking for a similar result this weekend.

Sheffield United and Tottenham will be looking to put past performances behind them as they look to get bragging rights in this week's London derby.

Sheffield United struggled to get a result at home against Man United and Frank Lampard's side will be desperate to assert their authority at home, but the head coach is not concerned about the club's current form.

Lampard said: " I don�t like losing games, the way we are losing games.

"Losing games, particularly at home, where we have had big chunks of possession, big chances at goal, around goal but not finishing. It is a reality that is getting clearer all the time.

"We are not getting enough goals in the striker areas."

Elsewhere, Jose Mourinho voiced his frustrations over the choices up top as Tottenham struggle to find a viable solution with Son Heung-min and Harry Kane both injured..
