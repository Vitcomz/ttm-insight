High School Football Kicks Off Across The State Amid Major COVID Related Challenges

The excitement in Dr. Hines voice must means that the high school football season is ready to kick off in one of the most competitive states in the country.

Hines shared the story in a pre-season kickoff conference call Tuesday with the Georgia Association of Broadcasters. The main topic Hines discussed was how the GHSA and its over-400 member schools have dealt with COVID-19 within their school environments and how they are preparing for Wednesday's Corky Kell Kickoff Classic and the other games that are part of this opening week of football. 

Dr. Hines and the GHSA’s Sports Medicine Advisory Council (SMAC) have had constant conversations about the state of play all spring and summer and Hines says their guidelines for a return were more restrictive than required to have fall sports return to campuses. But Hines feels athletics are an invaluable part of the high school experience and he was determined to have sports take place this fall. 

“The bottom line is the Georgia High School Association is going to provide a framework of opportunities for young people,” Hines said. “We believe, and I have believed it my whole career, that there are things we can learn through sports and activities that you’re not going to learn other than there. You need to learn to be a good leader. You need to learn to be a good follower. You need to learn to lose gracefully and win humbly and how to be a good employee… all these life lessons are important.”

The diversity of the state and how the pandemic has affected each and every county is something Hines has kept in mind the entire time while trying to bring a football season to its 2020 opening week. 

“Early on,” he said, “that was probably the biggest struggle that we had of trying to get us to (start).”

Nine schools are canceling their 2020 seasons altogether and almost 60 more are not starting at the same time as their GHSA counterparts. Hines admits that the GHSA is still trying to learn as much as they can in an environment where the information changes fairly regularly. The regular season has been moved back two weeks and the state championships are now going to be played after Christmas.
